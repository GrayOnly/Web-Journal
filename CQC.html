                    <p style="font-size: 20px; color:blue"><b>What is Cloud Computing?</b></p>
                        <p><b>Cloud</b> computing is on-demand access, via the internet, to computing resources applications,
                            servers (physical servers and virtual servers), data storage, development tools, networking
                            capabilities, and more hosted at a remote data center managed by a cloud services provider
                            (or CSP). The CSP makes these resources available for a monthly subscription fee or bills them
                            according to usage.</p>
                        <p>Compared to traditional on-premises IT, and depending on the cloud services you select, cloud
                            computing helps do the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Lower IT costs:</b> Cloud lets you offload some or most of the costs and effort of
                                    purchasing, installing, configuring, and managing your own on-premises infrastructure.</li>
                                <li><b>Improve agility and time-to-value:</b> With the cloud, your organization can start using
                                    enterprise applications in minutes, instead of waiting weeks or months for IT to respond
                                    to a request, purchase and configure supporting hardware, and install the software.
                                    Cloud also lets you empower certain users specifically developers and data
                                    scientists to help themselves to software and support infrastructure.</li>
                                <li><b>Scale more easily and cost-effectively:</b> Cloud provides elasticity instead of purchasing
                                    excess capacity that sits unused during slow periods, you can scale capacity up and
                                    down in response to spikes and dips in traffic. You can also take advantage of your cloud
                                    provider’s global network to spread your applications closer to users around the world.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>The term ‘cloud computing’ also refers to the technology that makes cloud work. This includes
                            some form of virtualized IT infrastructure servers, operating system software, networking, and
                            other infrastructure that’s abstracted, using special software, so that it can be pooled and
                            divided irrespective of physical hardware boundaries. For example, a single hardware server
                            can be divided into multiple virtual servers.</p>
                        <p>Virtualization enables cloud providers to make maximum use of their data center resources.
                            Not surprisingly, many corporations have adopted the cloud delivery model for their on-
                            premises infrastructure so they can realize maximum utilization and cost savings vs.
                            traditional IT infrastructure and offer the same self-service and agility to their end-users.</p>
                        <p>If you use a computer or mobile device at home or at work, you almost certainly use some form
                            of cloud computing every day, whether it’s a cloud application like Google Gmail or Salesforce,
                            streaming media like Netflix, or cloud file storage like Dropbox. Industry analyst Gartner
                            
                            recently projected that worldwide end-user public cloud spending will reach nearly USD 600
                            billion in 2023 (link resides outside ibm.com).</p>

                        <p style="font-size: 20px; color:blue"><b>Types of Cloud Computing</b></p>
                            <p><b>Public Cloud</b></p>
                                <p>Public cloud is a type of cloud computing in which a cloud service provider makes computing
                                    resources anything from SaaS applications, to individual virtual machines (VMs), to bare metal
                                    computing hardware, to complete enterprise grade infrastructures and development
                                    platforms available to users over the public internet. These resources might be accessible for
                                    free, or access might be sold according to subscription-based or pay-per-usage pricing models.</p>
                                <p>Public cloud is a multi-tenant environment the cloud provider&#39;s data center infrastructure is
                                    shared by all public cloud customers. In the leading public clouds Amazon Web Services
                                    (AWS), Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud,those customers can
                                    number in the millions.</p>
                            <p><b>Private Cloud</b></p>
                                <p>Private cloud is a cloud environment in which all cloud infrastructure and computing resources
                                are dedicated to, and accessible by, one customer only. Private cloud combines many of the
                                benefits of cloud computing including elasticity, scalability, and ease of service delivery—with
                                the access control, security, and resource customization of on-premises infrastructure.</p>
                                <p>A private cloud is typically hosted on-premises in the customer&#39;s data center. But a private
                                    cloud can also be hosted on an independent cloud provider’s infrastructure or built on rented
                                    infrastructure housed in an offsite data center.</p>
                                <p>Many companies choose private cloud over public cloud because private cloud is an easier way
                                    (or the only way) to meet their regulatory compliance requirements. Others choose private
                                    cloud because their workloads deal with confidential documents, intellectual property,
                                    personally identifiable information (PII), medical records, financial data, or other sensitive data.</p>
                            <p><b>Hybrid Cloud</b></p>
                                <p>Hybrid cloud is just what it sounds like a combination of public and private cloud
                                    environments. Specifically, and ideally, a hybrid cloud connects an organization&#39;s private cloud
                                    services and public clouds into a single, flexible infrastructure for running the organization’s
                                    applications and workloads.</p>
                                <p>The goal of hybrid cloud is to establish a mix of public and private cloud resources and with a
                                    level of orchestration between them that gives an organization the flexibility to choose the
                                    optimal cloud for each application or workload and to move workloads freely between the two
                                    clouds as circumstances change. This enables the organization to meet its technical and
                                    business objectives more effectively and cost-efficiently than it could with public or private
                                    cloud alone.</p>
                            <p><b>Multicloud and Hybrid Multicloud</b></p>
                                <p>Multicloud is the use of two or more clouds from two or more different cloud providers. Having
                                    a multicloud environment can be as simple using email SaaS from one vendor and image editing
                                    SaaS from another. But when enterprises talk about multicloud, they&#39;re typically talking about
                                    using multiple cloud services including SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS services from two or more of the
                                    leading public cloud providers.</p>
                                <p>Organizations choose multicloud to avoid vendor lock-in, to have more services to choose from,
                                    and to access to more innovation. But the more clouds you use—each with its own set of
                                    management tools, data transmission rates, and security protocolst he more difficult it can be
                                    to manage your environment. Multicloud management platforms provide visibility across
                                    multiple provider clouds through a central dashboard, where development teams can see their
                                    projects and deployments, operations teams can keep an eye on clusters and nodes, and the
                                    cybersecurity staff can monitor for threats.</p>
                            <p><b>Cloud Security</b></p>
                                <p>Traditionally, security concerns have been the primary obstacle for organizations
                                    considering cloud services, particularly public cloud services. In response to demand, however,
                                    the security offered by cloud service providers is steadily outstripping on-premises security
                                    solutions.</p>
                                <p>Maintaining cloud security demands different procedures and employee skillsets than in legacy
                                    IT environments. Some cloud security best practices include the following:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>Shared responsibility for security:</b> Generally, the cloud provider is responsible for
                                            securing cloud infrastructure and the customer is responsible for protecting its data
                                            within the cloud—but it&#39;s also important to clearly define data ownership between
                                            private and public third parties.</li>
                                        <li><b>Data encryption:</b> Data should be encrypted while at rest, in transit, and in use.
                                            Customers need to maintain full control over security keys and hardware security
                                            module.</li>
                                        <li><b>User identity and access management:</b> Customer and IT teams need full understanding
                                            of and visibility into network, device, application, and data access.</li>
                                        <li><b>Collaborative management:</b> Proper communication and clear, understandable
                                            processes between IT, operations, and security teams will ensure seamless cloud
                                            integrations that are secure and sustainable.</li>
                                        <li><b>Security and compliance monitoring:</b> This begins with understanding all regulatory

                                            connected systems and cloud-based services to maintain visibility of all data exchanges
                                            between public, private, and hybrid cloud environments.</li>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; color:blue"><b> What is Quantum Computing</b></p>
                                    <p>Quantum computing is a rapidly-emerging technology that harnesses the laws of
                                        quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers. Today, IBM Quantum makes real quantum hardware a tool scientists only began to imagine
                                        three decades ago -- available to hundreds of thousands of developers. Our engineers deliver
                                        ever-more-powerful superconducting quantum processors at regular intervals, alongside crucial
                                        advances in software and quantum-classical orchestration. This work drives toward the
                                        quantum computing speed and capacity necessary to change the world.</p>
                                    <p><b>How do Quantum Computers Work?</b></p>
                                        <p>Quantum computers are elegant machines, smaller and requiring less energy than
                                            supercomputers. An IBM Quantum processor is a wafer not much bigger than the one found in
                                            a laptop. And a quantum hardware system is about the size of a car, made up mostly of cooling
                                            systems to keep the superconducting processor at its ultra-cold operational temperature.</p>
                                    <p><b>Superfluids</b></p>
                                            <P>Your desktop computer likely uses a fan to get cold enough to work. Our quantum
                                                processors need to be very cold – about a hundredth of a degree above absolute zero. To
                                                achieve this, we use super-cooled superfluids to create superconductors.</P>
                                    <p><b>Superconductors</b></p>
                                            <p>At those ultra-low temperatures certain materials in our processors exhibit another
                                                important quantum mechanical effect: electrons move through them without resistance. This
                                                makes them &quot;superconductors.&quot;</p>
                                            <p>When electrons pass through superconductors they match up, forming &quot;Cooper pairs.&quot;
                                                These pairs can carry a charge across barriers, or insulators, through a process known as
                                                quantum tunneling. Two superconductors placed on either side of an insulator form a
                                                Josephson junction.</p>
                                    <p><b>Control</b></p>
                                            <p>Our quantum computers use Josephson junctions as superconducting qubits. By firing
                                                microwave photons at these qubits, we can control their behavior and get them to hold,
                                                change, and read out individual units of quantum information.</p>
                                    <p><b>Superposition</b></p>
                                            <p>A qubit itself isn&#39;t very useful. But it can perform an important trick: placing the
                                                quantum information it holds into a state of superposition, which represents a combination of
                                                all possible configurations of the qubit. Groups of qubits in superposition can create complex,
                                                multidimensional computational spaces. Complex problems can be represented in new ways in
                                                these spaces.</p>
                                    <p><b>Entanglement</b></p>
                                            <p>Entanglement is a quantum mechanical effect that correlates the behavior of two
                                                separate things. When two qubits are entangled, changes to one qubit directly impact the
                                                other. Quantum algorithms leverage those relationships to find solutions to complex problems.</p>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li><b>Faster computation:</b> Quantum computers can solve certain types of problems much
                                            faster than classical computers. This is because quantum computers use qubits, which
                                            can exist in multiple states at once, allowing them to perform many calculations
                                            simultaneously. Some problems that would take billions of years for classical computers
                                            to solve can be solved in seconds or minutes on a quantum computer.</li>
                                        <li><b>Improved encryption:</b> Quantum computers can break many of the encryption methods
                                            currently used in digital communication. However, they can also be used to develop
                                            new, more secure methods of encryption that would be nearly impossible to break
                                            using classical computing methods.</li>
                                        <li><b>Better optimization:</b> Many real-world problems involve finding the best solution among
                                            a large number of possibilities. Quantum computers can perform optimization tasks
                                            much more efficiently than classical computers, allowing for more accurate and
                                            effective solutions to complex problems.</li>
                                        <li><b>More accurate simulations:</b> Quantum computers can simulate quantum systems much
                                            more accurately than classical computers. This is because classical computers must
                                            simulate each possible state of a system one at a time, while quantum computers can
                                            simulate all possible states simultaneously.</li>
                                        <li><b>Improved machine learning:</b> Quantum computing can be used to improve machine
                                            learning algorithms, allowing for more accurate predictions and faster data analysis.</li>

                                                More precisely, it is able to accurately predict that a given image belongs to a certain
                                                class. For example, a social media company might want to use it to automatically
                                                identify and segregate objectionable images uploaded by users.</li>
                                            <li><b>Object detection</b> can use image classification to identify a certain class of image and
                                                then detect and tabulate their appearance in an image or video. Examples include
                                                detecting damages on an assembly line or identifying machinery that requires
                                                maintenance.</li>
                                            <li><b>Object tracking</b> follows or tracks an object once it is detected. This task is often
                                                executed with images captured in sequence or real-time video feeds. Autonomous
                                                vehicles, for example, need to not only classify and detect objects such as pedestrians,
                                                other cars and road infrastructure, they need to track them in motion to avoid collisions
