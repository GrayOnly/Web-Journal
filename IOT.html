                    <p><b>History of IoT</b></p>
                    <p>The Internet of Things has not been around for very long. However, there have been visions of
                machines communicating with one another since the early 1800s. Machines have been providing direct
                communications since the telegraph (the first landline) was developed in the 1830s and 1840s. Described
                as “wireless telegraphy,” the first radio voice transmission took place on June 3, 1900, providing another
                necessary component for developing the Internet of Things. The development of computers began in the
                1950s.
                <br><br>
                The Internet, itself a significant component of the IoT, started out as part of DARPA (Defense
                Advanced Research Projects Agency) in 1962 and evolved into ARPANET in 1969. In the 1980s,
                commercial service providers began supporting public use of ARPANET, allowing it to evolve into our
                modern Internet. Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) became a reality in early 1993, with the Department
                of Defense providing a stable, highly functional system of 24 satellites. This was quickly followed by
                privately owned, commercial satellites being placed in orbit. Satellites and landlines provide basic
                communications for much of the IoT. One additional and important component in developing a functional
                IoT was IPV6’s remarkably intelligent decision to increase address space.
                <br><br>
                The Internet of Things, as a concept, wasn’t officially named until 1999. One of the first examples
                of an Internet of Things is from the early 1980s and was a Coca Cola machine, located at the Carnegie
                Melon University. Local programmers would connect by the Internet to the refrigerated appliance, and
                check to see if there was a drink available and if it was cold, before making the trip.
                <br><br>
                By the year 2013, the Internet of Things had evolved into a system using multiple technologies,
                ranging from the Internet to wireless communication and from micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)
                to embedded systems. The traditional fields of automation (including the automation of buildings and
                homes), wireless sensor networks, GPS, control systems, and others, all support the IoT.
                <br><br>
                Kevin Ashton, the Executive Director of Auto-ID Labs at MIT, was the first to describe the Internet
                of Things, during his 1999 speech. Kevin Ashton stated that Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) was a
                prerequisite for the Internet of Things. He concluded if all devices were “tagged,” computers could manage,
                track, and inventory them. To some extent, the tagging of things has been achieved through technologies
                such as digital watermarking, barcodes, and QR codes.</p>

                    <p><b>What is IoT?</b><br></p>
                    
                    <p>The description of the Internet of Things is related to different definitions used by several groups
                    for promoting the particular concept in the whole world.
                        <ul>
                            <li>According to the Internet Architecture Board’s (IAB) definition, IoT is the networking of smart
                                objects, meaning a huge number of devices intelligently communicating in the presence of internet protocol
                                that cannot be directly operated by human beings but exist as components in buildings, vehicles or the
                                environment.</li>
                            <li>According to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) organization’s definition, IoT is the
                                networking of smart objects in which smart objects have some constraints such as limited bandwidth,
                                power, and processing accessibility for achieving interoperability among smart objects.</li>
                            <li>According to the IEEE Communications category magazine’s definition, IoT is a framework of
                                all things that have a representation in the presence of the internet in such a way that new applications and
                                services enable the interaction in the physical and virtual world in the form of Machine-to-Machine (M2M)
                                communication in the cloud.</li>
                            <li>According to the Oxford dictionary’s definition, IoT is the interaction of everyday object’s
                                computing devices through the Internet that enables the sending and receiving of useful data.</li>
                            <li>The term Internet of Things (IoT) according to the 2020 conceptual framework is expressed
                                through a simple formula such as: IoT= Services+ Data+ Networks + Sensors</li>
                        </ul></p>

                       

                        <p><b>How does IOT works?</b></p>
                                <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of real-world items that have sensors, software, and other technologies built into them so they can gather and share data. 
                                    These products might range from common household goods to sophisticated machinery. 
                                    An IoT platform receives the data once it has been collected, stores it, and processes it to produce insights and prompt actions. 
                                </p>
                        <p><b>Devices and Networks</b></p>
                                <p>The IoT devices include wireless sensors, software, actuators, computer devices and more. 
                                    They are attached to a particular object that operates through the internet, enabling the transfer of data among objects or people automatically without human intervention.
                                    <br><br>
                                    IoT devices share the sensor data they collect by connecting to an IoT gateway or other edge device where data is either sent to the cloud to be analyzed or analyzed locally. 
                                    Sometimes, these devices communicate with other related devices and act on the information they get from one another
                                </p><br>

                        <p><b>Advantages and Disadvantages of IOT</b></p>

                        <p><b>Applications of IoT</b></p>
                            <p>The versatile nature of IoT makes it an attractive option for so many businesses,
                                organizations, and government branches, that it doesn’t make sense to ignore it. Here’s a sample of various industries, and how IoT can be best applied.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Agriculture- For indoor planting, IoT makes monitoring and management of micro-
                                        climate conditions a reality, which in turn increases production. For outside planting, devices using IoT technology can sense soil moisture and nutrients, in conjunction with weather data, better control smart irrigation and fertilizer systems.</li>
                                    <li>Consumer Use-For private citizens, IoT devices in the form of wearables and smart homes make life easier. Wearables cover accessories such as Fitbit, smartphones, Apple watches, health monitors, to name a few. These devices improve entertainment, network connectivity, health, and fitness. </li>
                                    <li> Healthcare- First and foremost, wearable IoT devices let hospitals monitor their patients’ health at home, thereby reducing hospital stays while still providing up to the minute real-time information that could save lives. In hospitals, smart beds keep the staff informed as to the availability, thereby cutting wait time for free space. Putting IoT sensors on critical equipment means fewer breakdowns and increased reliability, which can mean the difference between life and death.</li>
                                    <li>Insurance- Even the insurance industry can benefit from the IoT revolution. Insurance companies can offer their policyholders discounts for IoT wearables such as Fitbit. By employing fitness tracking, the insurer can offer customized policies and encourage healthier habits, which in the long run benefits everyone, insurer, and customer alike.</li>
                                    <li> Manufacturing - The world of manufacturing and industrial automation is another big winner in the IoT sweepstakes. RFID and GPS technology can help a manufacturer track a product from its
                                        start on the factory floor to its placement in the destination store, the whole supply chain from start to finish.
                                        These sensors can gather information on travel time, product condition, and environmental conditions that
                                        the product was subjected to. Sensors attached to factory equipment can help identify bottlenecks in the production line, thereby reducing lost time and waste. Other sensors mounted on those same machines can
                                        also track the performance of the machine, predicting when the unit will require maintenance,nthereby preventing costly breakdowns.</li>
                                    <li>Retail - IoT sensors can help retailers control warehouse automation and robotics, analyze mall traffic, target customers based on past purchases, and craft personalized promotions for loyal customers.</li>
                                    <li> Utilities - IoT sensors can be used to monitor environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, and lighting, allowing algorithms to regulate energy usage and make adjustments. This allows businesses and private residences to experience significant energy savings, which benefits everyone, including the environment. Data gathered by IoT sensors can also be used to help run municipal power grids more efficiently and pinpoint outages faster, increasing the response time of repair crews and decreasing blackout times.</li>
